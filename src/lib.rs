//! # Hyper Router
//!
//! This cargo is a small extension to the great Hyper HTTP library. It basically is
//! adds the ability to define routes to request handlers and then query for the handlers
//! by request path.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! To use the library just add: 
//! 
//! ```
//! hyper-router = "*"
//! ```
//!
//! to your dependencies.
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate hyper;
//! extern crate hyper_router;
//!
//! use hyper::server::{Server, Request, Response};
//! use hyper::method::Method::Get;
//! use hyper_router::{Route, RouterBuilder, Path};
//!
//! fn basic_handler(_: Request, res: Response) {
//!   res.send(b"Hello World!").unwrap();
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!   let router = RouterBuilder::new()
//!     .add(Route {
//!       method: Get,
//!       path: Path::new("/greet"),
//!       handler: basic_handler
//!     })
//!     .build();
//!
//!   Server::http("0.0.0.0:8080").unwrap()
//!     .handle(move |request: Request, response: Response| {
//!       let handler = router.find_handler(&request);
//!       handler(request, response);
//!     }).unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This code will start Hyper server and add use router to find handlers for request.
//! We create the `Route` so that when we visit path `/greet` the `basic_handler` handler
//! will be called.
//!
//! ## Things to note
//!
//! * `Path::new` method accepts regular expressions so you can match every path you please.
//! * If you have request matching multiple paths the one that was first `add`ed will be chosen.
//! * This library is in an early stage of development so there may be breaking changes comming
//! (but I'll try as hard as I can not to break backwards compatibility or break it just a little - 
//! I promise I'll try!).
//!
//! # Further Development
//!
//! * add the ability to distinguish requests by query parameters.
//! * maybe some small API changes/upgrades
//! * thinking about returning `Result<Handler, StatusCode>` in case of any error in
//! `find_handler` (and will probably go with it). This will actually enable users to server their
//! own error pages.
//!
//! # Waiting for your feedback
//!
//! I've created this little tool to help myself learn Rust and to avoid using big frameworks
//! like Iron or rustful. I just want to keep things simple.
//!
//! Obviously I could make some errors or bad design choices so I'm waiting for your feedback!
//! You may create an issue at [project's bug tracker](https://github.com/marad/hyper-router/issues).
